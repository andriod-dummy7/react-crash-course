# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# react-crash-course


This practice project, detailed on YouTube at https://youtu.be/LDB4uaJ87e0 by Traversy Media, is, in my view, the most effective video for learning React and its core concepts. It provides a clear and beginner-friendly explanation of concepts such as Hooks and props.
